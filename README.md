# ADALM-PLUTO + Python MPSK Modulation and Demodulation Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to use ADALM-PLUTO and Python to perform MPSK (M-ary Phase Shift Keying) modulation and demodulation for communication. We will go through the setup, data generation, modulation, transmission, reception, synchronization, and symbol error rate (SER) analysis.
